[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/omniauth-classlink.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/omniauth-classlink)

# Fork

The reason we have forked this is to allow for ignoring provider state if we are directly linking into the classlink omniauth callback route.  THis method is modeled after the omniauth-clever gem. Without the ignore provider state option and handling links from the classlink portal will always fail with a csrf error.

# OmniAuth ClassLink
Unofficial OmniAuth strategy for [ClassLink](https://classlink.com) integration.

# Installation

Add the gem to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-classlink'
```
And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

# Usage

First, you need to have your OAuth2 application registered in ClassLink. After creating one, you'll be provided with access key and secret that should be used for configuring the gem.

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :class_link, 'your-classlink-access-key', 'your-classlink-secret', strategy_class: 'OmniAuth::Strategies::ClassLink'
end
```

Or, alternatively, if you use [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise), you can put this in the `Devise.setup` section:

```ruby
 config.omniauth :class_link,
                 'your-classlink-access-key',
                 'your-classlink-secret',
                 strategy_class: 'OmniAuth::Strategies::ClassLink'
```
